## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   A SerpApi API Key. You can get one for free from [serpapi.com](https://serpapi.com/).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Key

This application uses Streamlit's secrets management.

1.  Create a directory named `.streamlit` in the root of the project.
2.  Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
3.  Add your SerpApi key to this file in the following format:

    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml
    [api]
    serp_key = "YOUR_SERPAPI_KEY_HERE"
    ```

**Important:** The `secrets.toml` file is included in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to your repository to keep your API key private.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser should open a new tab with the application running. Enter your skills and interests to start finding opportunities!
